In his new book ""The Asian 21st Century,"" Mahbubani offers a comprehensive and in-depth study of the global dynamics and challenges as well as concrete solutions for restoring international governance. How should China and the United States cope with each other in the face of geopolitical tensions? Is the ""American Dream"" fading today? Mahbubani says that at the international level, the U.S. should stop trying to prevent the return of China, which cannot succeed, and that an all-out geopolitical contest would be bad for the two countries and the world. He also says the ""American Dream"" has been badly damaged, and that the U.S. has become a plutocracy where the government is ""of the 1 percent, by the 1 percent, and for the 1 percent."" The average income in the U.S. for people in the bottom 50 percent hasn't gone up for 30 years, whereas those in the top 1 percent are seeing tremendous exponential growth in their wealth.

Having at least 70% of the Americas vaccinated by mid-2022 is the goal of the Pan American Health Organization, which aims to deliver 100 million vaccine doses to 33 countries, PAHO director Carissa Etienne said Wednesday.An executive order signed Wednesday by the Governor of the U.S. state of New Jersey said all health care workers employed in the state are required to receive primary doses of COVID-19 vaccines plus a booster with no option to test-out.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an ensemble forecast published Wednesday that more than 61,000 people could die in the country in next four weeks from COVID-19.  The CDC also said Wednesday that vaccination against COVID-19 protects against hospitalization significantly more than natural immunity from a COVID-19 infection. The American coffee chain Starbucks reversed its decision to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for all of its employees, following the U.S. Supreme Court decision not to enforce President Biden’s vaccine and testing mandate for companies with over 100 employees.#CGTNAmerica",0,191,203,2022-01-21 02:28:23

248,4,https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesDaily/posts/5136005633117879,"Agricultural products with geographical indications win favor with Chinese consumersBoasting high quality, high brand awareness, and good reputation, agricultural products with geographical indications (GIs) ride the wave of consumption upgrading in China and satisfy the needs of Chinese consumers who desire a high-quality life.Cao Junzhe, a resident in Fengtai district of Beijing, has bought Nanfeng mandarin orange, a local specialty and national GI product of Nanfeng county, Fuzhou city, east China’s Jiangxi province, many times. Besides enjoying it himself, he also sent the fruit to his parents who live in another city.Although the prices of GI products are higher than those of ordinary agricultural products, he thinks they are worth buying, according to Cao, who said he has always preferred GI agricultural products since he realized the unique advantages of such products.In fact, GI products in China, such as Zhangqiu green onion, Yantai apple, Anji white tea, and Nanfeng mandarin orange, have become the choices for many consumers in China today.The name of a GI product is often the combination of the name of the region where the product is produced and the common name of the product. The names of GI products indicate their places of origin and superior quality.In recent years, China has continuously enhanced the protection of GI agricultural products. Data showed that since the country implemented programs to protect GI agricultural products, more than 3,000 kinds of GI agricultural products have been cultivated and registered across the country.These products have been accepted and recognized by more and more consumers and have relatively stable consumer groups in the market.GI products are the part of characteristic agriculture that has the most brand value and represent the direction in which agricultural products can develop toward the goal of becoming high-end goods, said Li Xuelin, head of Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences.The rapid development of e-commerce in China’s rural areas has created a broader market space for GI agricultural products.Data from China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOC) revealed that the online retail sales in rural areas of China hit 1.79 trillion yuan (about $282 billion) in 2020, which was 5.1 times that in 2015 and signaled a growth rate far higher than that of the country’s e-commerce on the whole.In 2020, China’s online retail sales of agricultural products reached 415.89 billion yuan, accounting for 10 percent of the country’s total retail sales of agricultural products.E-commerce in rural areas has smoothened the sales channels for GI agricultural products, shortened the buyer decision process, and improved the popularity of such products.GI agricultural products are not only goods, but also drivers of the development of regional industrial chain. Inspired by the development model of GI agricultural products, many regions in China have created the model of “GI + cultural tourism”, aiming to promote the integration and complementarity of GI, cultural and creative industries, as well as other related industries.Meizhou city in south China’s Guangdong province, Qingchuan county in Guangyuan city of southwest China’s Sichuan province, and Chishui city in southwest China’s Guizhou province have deeply integrated GI agricultural products into rural tourism. By boosting the business of B&Bs, rolling out tourism products, building agricultural brands, and developing characteristic agriculture and leisure agriculture, they ensure tourists not only enjoy delicious food but also have fun.The advantages of GI agricultural products, namely unique resources and cultural appeal, have stimulated the vitality of rural development.Experts believe that besides fruits and vegetables, the range of GI agricultural products will be further expanded to various links of the entire industrial chain, including highly processed products.

Airline industry officials say the decision by AT&T and Verizon to delay activating 5G towers near many airports, under pressure from the White House, has helped defuse the situation. The industry says this delay is giving the Federal Aviation Administration more time to clear more planes for operation under 5G networks. The FAA has already granted new approvals that will allow about 78% of U.S. airlines to make landings even under low visibility, at airports where the new wireless service is on. About one-fifth of planes will be vulnerable to being prevented from landing at some airports during bad weather, but that amount is likely to decrease, reports the Associated Press. According to the CEO’s of American and United Airlines, they don’t expect major flight disruptions. #travel #tourism #5G #wireless #airport #cgtnamerica",90,5,10,2022-01-22 06:52:09

Petito’s parents opened a missing person’s case after Laundrie returned to Florida without her and Petito was no longer answering her messages.Laundrie would later go missing in September, leading authorities to search for him as a “person of interest.”Petito’s remains would be found on Sept 19 in Wyoming, with the coroner ruling her death a homicide by manual strangulation.

They are the “rooms” of the popular local B&B hotel that offer tourists a good view of the starry sky at night.Customers need to make reservations many days in advance to get one, according to a staff member of the hotel.“Eight years ago, I wouldn’t believe it if someone told me our village would become so beautiful one day,” said Tan Jie, secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) general branch of Sanhe village, while looking at the unsurfaced roads of the village in photos taken in 2013 before the village was transformed.From an ordinary little village into a well-known tourist destination, Sanhe has made great efforts to develop rural tourism, according to Tan.The village has sorted out and integrated 63 sites with resources of the distinctive local ecosystem featuring the organic integration of rural residences and surrounding trees, bamboo groves, rivers, farmland and other elements of the natural environment, and introduced 24 music-themed cultural and creative projects as well as five high-quality B&B businesses.By holding activities such as music festivals and concerts of folk songs and folk music, the village attracts more than 200,000 visitors a year, who bring to the village over 30 million yuan ($4.7 million) in consumption growth.Thanks to its great advantages in the market, industrial vitality, and important role in driving the development of related industries, rural tourism has achieved notable results in boosting employment, improving living environment, stimulating digital transformation, and improving infrastructure in villages across the country.Rural tourism can promote continuous improvement in the infrastructure and public services of villages, raise local residents’ awareness of the protection of natural and cultural environment, and further improve rural development environment, said Wu Liyun, associate professor at China Academy of Culture and Tourism under Beijing International Studies University.Meanwhile, the prosperity of rural tourism can motivate young people working in urban areas to return to their hometowns to start their own businesses or find a new job near their homes, thus boosting the development of rural economy and solving the problem of “hollow village”, according to Wu.As China witnesses fast upgrading of domestic demands for tourism consumption, rural tourism is also responding to the changing demands of tourists. Local governments are intensifying efforts to deepen the integration of rural tourism and various industries, online and offline services, develop more new products, new forms of business, and new tourism experiences, and provide more high-quality services for tourists to stimulate the development of rural areas.

514,1,https://www.facebook.com/ChinaGlobalTVNetwork/posts/501068271386650," After reflecting on the events of last year, this week, The Agenda’s Stephen Cole is back to the future in this special programme: Forecasting 2022. France will vote to elect a new president in April. Current president, Emmanuel Macron's second-round opponent from 2017, the far-right populist Marine Le Pen, has already launched her campaign. And there are many others who could also take France forward. So, to discuss the country's political outlook for 2022 and beyond, The Agenda’s Stephen Cole is joined by Jacques Reland, Senior Research Fellow with the Global Policy Institute. The fight to save the planet was the big issue of 2021 - with the pandemic delayed #COP26 Climate gathering in Glasgow and the virtual element of #COP15 in Kunming both aimed at saving the planet.As the face-to-face Part 2 of COP15 scheduled in April, we talk to Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the Global Leader of Climate and Energy at the WWF to discuss what further action we need to take in 2022.2021 was once again a year dominated by the pandemic. Despite progress with first, second and booster jabs, the #Omicron variant has led to further uncertainty for us all. But as we move into 2022, is there more optimism for the NEXT 12 months? One of the people who is best placed to answer that question is Dr Margaret Harris from the World Health Organization.  The big event at the beginning of this year is the 24th winter Olympic Games in Beijing. Thousands of athletes will gather as Beijing becomes the first ever city to host both the summer and winter olympics. Chef d'equipe of the French team for #Beijing2022 and a three-time Olympian herself, Nathalie Pechalat talks to us about what we can expect in the continuing shadow of covid.And finally, we couldn't have a show about forecasting without looking to the stars to see what they have in store for us. 2021 brought a mix of the expected - the continuation of the pandemic - and the completely UNexpected - new varients, Joe Biden becoming US President and Germany's most experienced leader Angela Merkel standing down as Chancellor. World-famous astrologer Susan Miller tells us what is in her crystal ball about 2022.Watch #TheAgenda in full and find out more at: https://www.cgtn.com/europe/the-agenda ",16,1,0,2022-01-23 00:48:31

France will vote to elect a new president in April. Current president, Emmanuel Macron's second-round opponent from 2017, the far-right populist Marine Le Pen, has already launched her campaign. And there are many others who could also take France forward. So, to discuss the country's political outlook for 2022 and beyond, The Agenda’s Stephen Cole is joined by Jacques Reland, Senior Research Fellow with the Global Policy Institute. The fight to save the planet was the big issue of 2021 - with the pandemic delayed #COP26 Climate gathering in Glasgow and the virtual element of #COP15 in Kunming both aimed at saving the planet.As the face-to-face Part 2 of COP15 scheduled in April, we talk to Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the Global Leader of Climate and Energy at the WWF to discuss what further action we need to take in 2022.2021 was once again a year dominated by the pandemic. Despite progress with first, second and booster jabs, the #Omicron variant has led to further uncertainty for us all. But as we move into 2022, is there more optimism for the NEXT 12 months? One of the people who is best placed to answer that question is Dr Margaret Harris from the World Health Organization.  The big event at the beginning of this year is the 24th winter Olympic Games in Beijing. Thousands of athletes will gather as Beijing becomes the first ever city to host both the summer and winter olympics. Chef d'equipe of the French team for #Beijing2022 and a three-time Olympian herself, Nathalie Pechalat talks to us about what we can expect in the continuing shadow of covid.And finally, we couldn't have a show about forecasting without looking to the stars to see what they have in store for us. 2021 brought a mix of the expected - the continuation of the pandemic - and the completely UNexpected - new varients, Joe Biden becoming US President and Germany's most experienced leader Angela Merkel standing down as Chancellor.

His movements are so smooth and neat that many users have dubbed him ""China's Michael Jackson.""Yu fell in love with breakdancing at the age of 13. The cool and stylish dance that his classmate performed at a class get-together fascinated him. However, he didn't get the opportunity to learn it systematically.After almost 30 years of working as a mechanic at a local garage, Yu decided to resume his passion for breakdancing and started to teach himself nuances of the dance through online tutorials. Although he wasn't busy with work as he used to be, self-learning was not an easy task either, especially for Yu, who still needed to juggle his day job and hardcore practice in the evening. ""Even the seemly easiest steps require practice that used to cause swelling and pain,"" Yu recalled.With five years of diligent practice, now, he can perfectly perform various dance movements like spacewalking, backsliding and other power moves.When asked about the secret of mastering breakdance, Yu said, ""It's all about passion and persistence. You can always find ways to learn it well as long as you love it.""",107,2,3,2022-01-25 00:45:08

While pursuing democracy, countries around the world have established different forms of democracy and jointly developed the political civilization of humankind.Chinese President Xi Jinping noted that there are many ways to achieve democracy, and there is no one-size-fits-all model.The key criterion for whether a country is democratic is whether its people are truly the masters of their own fate.Whether a country is democratic depends on whether the people have the right to vote, and more importantly, the right to participate extensively; whether they have been given verbal promises in elections, and more importantly, how many of these promises are fulfilled after elections; whether there are set political procedures and rules in state systems and laws, and more importantly, whether these systems and laws are truly enforced; whether the rules and procedures for the exercise of power are democratic, and more importantly, whether the exercise of power is genuinely subject to public scrutiny and checks.Democracy is not a decorative ornament, but an instrument for addressing the issues that concern the people. China’s whole-process people's democracy is a complete system with supporting mechanisms and procedures, and has been fully tested through wide participation.In China, the people enjoy broad democratic and political rights ensured by the Constitution and laws. They participate in the management of state affairs, social affairs, and economic and cultural affairs; they provide opinions and suggestions for the design of national development plans at the highest level, and also contribute to the governance of local public affairs. Democracy is achieved in every link, from democratic elections and consultations to decision-making, management, and oversight.Democracy and national governance operate in parallel. Progress in democracy and modernization of national governance are mutually reinforcing. One essential feature of a good model of democracy is that it will promote sound governance and boost national development. Whether a country is democratic and how it should achieve better democracy should be judged by its people.China’s whole-process people’s democracy can effectively adjust national political relations, coordinate wills and interests of all parties, unleash people’s enthusiasm, initiative and creativity, and build an institutional advantage that enables the country to concentrate resources to accomplish key national undertakings.China has completed a process of industrialization that took developed countries several centuries in the space of mere decades, and maintained long-term social stability while realizing rapid economic development. Whole-process people’s democracy is one of the keys to China’s two miracles of rapid economic development and long-term social stability. According to statistics, the level of public satisfaction with the Chinese government has remained above 90 percent for many years. The Chinese people are gaining in increasingly stronger sense of fulfillment, happiness and security due to China’s sound and effective national governance. Democracy is reliable and works well only when it is rooted in a country’s unique social environment, developed according to the country’s history, culture and tradition, as well as the exploration and innovation made by the people in the country, and suited to the country’s own modernization process. A country can learn from the models of democracy of other countries, but shall never duplicate them. The Communist Party of China has always been holding high the banner of people’s democracy. Uniting and leading the Chinese people to devise and develop democracy in accordance with China’s national conditions, characteristics and realities, the Party is unswervingly following the most suitable path to democracy.Facts have provided unequivocal evidence of the efficacy and vitality of democracy in China. China never seeks to export the Chinese model of democracy, nor does it allow any external force to change the Chinese model under any circumstances. It endeavors to increase democracy between nations, supports the independent choice by every country of its own path to democracy, and supports countries to safeguard their legitimate democratic rights and offer more opportunities for the world with their own development, so as to make the global governance system fairer and more equitable.

It can restore its initial state under the skin's temperature, thanks to its deformable material based on a shape memory alloy (SMA).The SMA, an alloy that can be deformed but will return to its original shape when heated, works to increase the dressing's contraction force on either linear or circular skin wounds.The researchers also designed an antibacterial film to enhance the body's electric field. The increased electric field can facilitate relevant cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation to promote wound healing metabolism.The researchers demonstrated on rats that the dressing ensured effective wound healing in as short as four and eight days for linear and circular wounds, respectively.It is over 50 percent quicker than the results in a control group in wound closure, said the study.Yao Guang, the paper's first author, said the new design is a successful example of temperature-responsive and battery-free intervention for biomedical applications.

By that time, China will have made a further step on its road to build a world-class transportation system.The circular says, between 2021 and 2025, China’s railway operation mileage will increase by 19,000 kilometers, highway operation mileage by 302,000 kilometers, and high-level inland river waterways by 2,400 kilometers. China is also aiming to have over 270 civil airports and a total mileage of urban transit of around 10,000 kilometers by 2025. Besides, more than 95 percent of cities with a population of over 500,000 will be connected to the country’s high-speed railway network, and a modern airport system will be basically completed. This will continue contributing to the improvement in the size, capability, quality and efficiency of the country’s comprehensive multidimensional transport network.According to the circular, China will strive to make secondary-level highways and above occupy 70 percent of its national highway system in the western region, and connect over 85 percent of unincorporated villages and groups with a large population to hardened roads. The country will also build around 100 rural logistics service brands by 2025.The circular says China will improve the collection and distribution system of transportation hubs. By 2025, over 70 percent of major coastal ports will be connected with railways, and more than 80 percent of aviation hubs connected with rail transit.The circular urges the country to continue optimizing transportation structure and improve the efficiency of the comprehensive transport network. The country will normalize price management in new businesses and models of the transport sector, and implement measures of tax and fee reduction for logistics enterprises.The circular estimates that by 2025, the annual revenue of China’s courier industry will exceed 1.8 trillion yuan ($283.67 billion), and around 150 billion parcels will be handled on a yearly basis. The industry will have an annual growth rate between 10 percent and 11 percent, which is twice of that of the country’s GDP.According to the circular, China will enhance its ability to offer equalized universal postal services during the 14th Five-Year Plan period to make courier services more convenient, more accessible and more reliable, said Zeng Junshan, director of the policy and regulation department, State Postal Bureau of China.Besides, the country will make smart parcel lockers and other devices in urban areas better meet the diversified demands of the people, and extend direct collecting and shipping services to basically all incorporated villages, Zeng said, adding that all border villages will be covered by postal services.By 2035, the National 1-2-3 Travel Circle and the Global 1-2-3 Logistics Circle will take initial shape, basically making China a country with a strong transportation network.The National 1-2-3 Travel Circle refers to one-hour commute time in cities, two hours' travel time within city clusters and three hours to travel between major domestic cities. The Global 1-2-3 Logistics Circle means one-day delivery to destinations within China, two-day delivery to neighboring countries, and three-day delivery to major global cities, according to the document.

It represents the first time that Chinese courier companies have expanded investment to airports, a result of the fast development of the industry as well as consumers’ high requirements for delivery timeliness.The airport’s 1.5-hour flight circle will cover 80 percent of China’s population. And flights departing from the airport can reach major airports in China within one night and those in foreign countries the next day.The annual cargo and mail throughput of Ezhou Huahu Airport is expected to reach 3.3 million tonnes by 2030.The fast expansion of the courier sector has provided opportunities for the rapid development of the logistics equipment industry.As express delivery business volume continues to grow, parcels can’t possibly all be sorted through manual work. The industry is in urgent need of a boost from technologies.Wayz Intelligent Manufacturing Technology Co., Ltd., a high-tech enterprise engaging in the in-depth research on core technologies of the logistics industry, was listed on the sci-tech innovation board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Oct. 26, 2021, the same year when it celebrated the 5th anniversary of its founding.By then, the company had delivered 300 sets of cross-belt sortation system. As of the end of 2021, its products had been exported to many countries and regions. The company plans to continuously strengthen the construction of overseas market channels and expand its business to more markets.Multinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca’s supply base in Wuxi city, east China’s Jiangsu province, has significantly improved efficiency in sending off goods by connecting its order system to SF DHL Supply Chain, a leading supply chain service provider in China.After entrusting the comprehensive management of its high-bay warehouses to SF DHL Supply Chain, the supply base can now send off up to 20,000 to 30,000 boxes of products a day, compared with merely 2,000 to 3,000 in the past.Chinese logistics company Suning Logistics has taken on after-sales services of manufacturing industry. Its employees not only deliver furniture consumers purchase online to their homes, but install the furniture for them.The fact that more and more courier companies have started to establish cooperative relations with manufacturing enterprises shows that besides providing delivery services express delivery companies are also trying to embed facilities, systems and services in the production, sale and even after-sales links of manufacturing enterprises, becoming inseparable from the production and circulation process of manufacturing.Cross-border courier services make it easier for consumers to purchase products from across the world and for companies to sell their products to various countries and regions.In November 2021, the seven distribution centers of Cainiao Network, the logistics arm of Alibaba Group, in Belgium’s Liege, Spain’s Madrid, France’s Paris, Germany’s Bremen, Italy’s Rome, Hungary’s Budapest and Russia’s Moscow were officially put into operation.Besides, Cainiao Network has also launched more than 300 charter flights, with an estimated cargo capacity of more than 30,000 tonnes.In fact, many Chinese courier companies have accelerated the business expanding in overseas markets in recent years, building a total of 240 overseas warehouses with a total area of nearly 2 million square meters.The vigorous development of the courier sector not only helps the manufacturing industry reduce costs and increase efficiency through integration with it, but also stimulates the overseas sales of domestic products, facilitates the cross-border flow of commodities, and brings more opportunities to the sector and other related industries.

He also urged the alignment of a capable government and an effective market.Xi urged enabling China's institutional advantages, resources, technology potentials and market vitality to play better roles in accelerating the formation of resource-conserving and environment-friendly industrial structures, production modes, living styles and spatial layout.Coordination should be strengthened to take concerted moves in reducing carbon emissions, cutting pollution, expanding green efforts and promoting growth, Xi said.On advancing energy revolution, Xi noted that the gradual exit of traditional energy sources should be based on the safe and reliable substitution of new energy sources.China should resolutely control fossil fuel consumption, especially regulating the growth of coal consumption in a strict and reasonable manner, Xi said.China should consolidate the foundation for domestic energy production, ensure coal supply security, and keep steady growth of crude oil and natural gas output, according to Xi.It is necessary to accelerate the development of new energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass and hydrogen energy that have scale and benefits, coordinate hydropower development and ecological protection, and actively develop nuclear power in a safe and orderly manner, according to Xi.On industrial upgrading, Xi urged efforts to deepen integration between green and low-carbon industry and new technologies like internet, big data, artificial intelligence, and 5G.Efforts should be made to increase the proportion of green and low-carbon sector in the Chinese economy while strictly curbing the blind expansion of energy-intensive, high emission and low-standard projects, he noted.Xi also underscored accelerating green and low-carbon technological revolution, calling for efforts to advance related technological breakthroughs, research and development, and application.The country should further improve the ""dual control"" system on both total energy consumption and energy intensity, as well as standards for carbon peaking and neutrality, and build a unified and standardized calculating system for carbon emissions, Xi said.Xi called for efforts to fully leverage market mechanism, improve carbon pricing mechanism and strengthen coordination in trading of electricity, carbon emission rights and energy consumption rights.China will take a more active role to participate in the global climate negotiations agenda and the formulation of international rules, with the aim of building a fair and equitable global climate governance system featuring mutually beneficial cooperation, Xi said.

The project consists of six individual buildings with either 4, 5, or 12 floors, and is unique in that the buildings are prefabricated. The project is divided into areas A and B, with a maximum building height of 60 metres.The SDIC Ecological Environment BuildingThe SDIC Ecological Environment Building covers an area of 11,933 square metres, with a building height of 30 metres. The project is positioned as a headquarters building in the Haikou Jiangdong New Area, and the total investment in the project is 630 million yuan. Keeping in line with the JDNA zero carbon, new city model, the design of the building is unique, with 50% of the roof area being covered in photovoltaic panels.Other major projects in the Haikou Jiangdong New AreaThe area hosts a number of international service facilities such as the British Harrow School, as well as the affiliated school of Beijing Normal University, Huandao School, and Guilin Yang University City.The campuses of colleges and universities are located within comprehensive functional areas that include the consulate area, an international consumption boutique exhibition centre, and an urban cultural exhibition area, which have been built to stimulate the vitality of urban development.Headquarters CBD of Jiangdong New Area has a planned area of 1.79 square kilometres, creating a world leading fourth-generation ecological CBD.Ecological Advantages of the Headquarters Economic ZoneThe Jiangdong New Area is creating a world leading ecological CBD in the headquarters economic cluster area, building a pioneering, zero-carbon new city where people and nature ""coexist, integrate and share"".1. Narrow roads and a dense network. The above-ground planning adopts a narrow road and dense network structure to create a multi-component complex block with pedestrian traffic as the mainstay. JDNA strictly controls the architectural style of the area, placing landmark buildings in the core area, and maintaining a limit on the overall building height.2. Development of underground space. For the contiguous comprehensive development of underground space, JDNA relies on rail transit stations to form three-dimensional complex, interconnected, vibrant underground blocks, forming an intensive spatial pattern with shared facilities and smooth connection between core areas.3. JDNA emphasizes ecological security by strictly controlling the 200-meter coastline setback space, setting up the Furong River and Daomeng River Wetland Parks on the east and west sides, and introducing wetlands into the city to form a flood and tide safety protection circle around the ecological CBD.4. JDNA is building a zero-carbon new city by promoting regional central cooling projects to reduce overall energy consumption. Through a series of planning and implementation measures, JDNA is developing the area into a zero-carbon new city demonstration zone.收起",156,1899,7599,2022-01-25 13:58:42

As inflation, debt, energy, and supply chain crises intertwine with each other, global economic recovery shows clear signs of uncertainty and imbalance.The World Bank Group lowered its projection of global economic growth for 2021 and 2022 in its latest Global Economic Prospects by 0.2 percentage point from its forecast made in June 2021.“The global economic recovery is facing significant headwinds amid new waves of COVID-19 infections, persistent labor market challenges, lingering supply-chain challenges and rising inflationary pressures,” pointed out the United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) 2022 released on Jan. 13.In order to promote steady world economic recovery, countries around the world need to correctly grasp the trend and governance of economic globalization.“Though countercurrents are sure to exist in a river, none could stop it from flowing to the sea. Driving forces bolster the river’s momentum, and resistance may yet enhance its flow. Despite the countercurrents and dangerous shoals along the way, economic globalization has never and will not veer off course,” Xi said at the 2022 WEF virtual session, using a river rushing forward toward the sea as a vivid metaphor for the irresistible trend of economic globalization.To facilitate steady recovery of the world economy, countries also need to properly understand the dialectical relationship between macro policies and micro policies. Xi has made targeted suggestions in this regard at the 2022 WEF virtual session.Major economies should see the world as one community, think in a more systematic way, increase policy transparency and information sharing, and coordinate the objectives, intensity and pace of fiscal and monetary policies, so as to prevent the world economy from plummeting again, Xi pointed out.“Major developed countries should adopt responsible economic policies, manage policy spillovers, and avoid severe impacts on developing countries. International economic and financial institutions should play their constructive role to pool global consensus, enhance policy synergy and prevent systemic risks,” he said.The opening of the 2022 WEF virtual session coincided with the release of China’s economic data in 2021, which showed that the country’s gross domestic product expanded 8.1 percent year-on-year last year.With sound overall growth momentum, the Chinese economy injects important impetus into steady recovery of the global economy.While advancing high-quality development, China has remained steadfast in expanding high-standard opening-up, aiming to share more of its development dividends with various countries and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results.The beginning of 2022 has witnessed many heartening stories of mutual benefit and win-win results, including overseas investment institutions’ further exploring the Chinese market, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement’s entry into effect, China’s further shortening its negative lists for foreign investment, and the continuous expansion of China’s “circle of friends” in the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, which will form a strong driving force for steady recovery of the global economy.

With these facilities, students of the sports school can now receive ice and snow sports training near their school.In an effort to popularize winter sports and develop relevant fitness and leisure activities, various regions in China have actively built fields and facilities for winter sports, including outdoor ice rinks and ski resorts as well as portable ice rinks, meeting the growing demands of people for ice and snow sports.Recently, a several-centimeter-thick dry ski mat made of special materials has won favor with consumers as it is easy to carry and use and is very practical.The application of special materials to winter sports, represented by the dry ski mat, has freed winter sports from dependency on seasons and facilities.Portable alternative materials and facilities have broken the constraints of time and space on winter sports and diversified the scenarios of these sports, allowing people to skate and ski whenever they want.In many regions, residents can take part in ice and snow sports activities in urban areas, learn winter sports skills in shopping malls, and experience the fun of these sports in parks and communities. Relevant activities and facilities have greatly increased public awareness of and participation in ice and snow sports.As the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games approach, the country is enveloped in an atmosphere of winter sports. More and more people find pleasure in ice and snow sports, which have been gradually integrated into people’s daily life.It is believed that the Beijing 2022 will further stimulate the development of ice and snow sports in China.

The history of humanity is a history of achieving growth by meeting various tests and of developing by overcoming various crises. We need to move forward by following the logic of historical progress, and develop by riding the tide of development of our times,” said Xi at the virtual session.Xi’s insightful remarks embody the scientific methodology of dialectical materialism, providing important guidance for grasping the trend of history and riding the waves of the times in the turbulent international situation.Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, believes that Xi’s speech pointed the way to a better future for China and the world.In the face of profound and extensive changes of the times, countries can only see clearly the right direction for human society through the “telescope” of history.Although the once-in-a-century pandemic has created many obstacles to the communication between peoples of different countries, facts have shown once again that countries are not riding separately in some 190 small boats, but are rather all in a giant ship on which their shared destiny hinges. Only through cooperation can they usher in a brighter future.The recovery and development of the world economy are faced with many constraints, but economic globalization has never and will not veer off course. Only by building an open world economy can countries fully unleash the vitality of the world economy.Although problems like a widening North-South gap, divergent recovery trajectories, development fault-lines and technology divisions become more prominent, mankind’s beautiful dream of common development will never fade. Only by adhering to a people-centered philosophy of development can countries realize balanced development worldwide and revitalize global development.Despite the resurgence of Cold War mentality, protectionism and unilateralism, peaceful development and win-win cooperation remain the right way forward for humanity. Different countries and civilizations can open up new space for global peaceful development only by prospering together on the basis of respect for each other, and seeking common ground and win-win outcomes by setting aside differences.In the face of the profound and sweeping changes of the times, the international community must forge ahead with confidence and fortitude and push the wheel of history toward a brighter future with practical actions.To take the initiative in the course of history, countries must pluck up the courage to overcome stubborn resistance and strong countercurrents along the way for a better future.“We need to learn from comparing long history cycles, and see the change in things through the subtle and minute. We need to foster new opportunities amidst crises, open up new horizons on a shifting landscape, and pool great strength to go through difficulties and challenges,” Xi said at the event. He encouraged the international community to face the issues of the times and create a better future with actions.Crises and opportunities are interconnected and dialectically united. Only by figuring out the way forward, grasping the general trend, observing the situation through dialectical thinking, gaining a deep understand of opportunities and challenges and actively creating conditions can countries turn crises into opportunities.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, people from various countries have supported and helped each other, showing humankind’s courage, resolve and compassion in front of a major crisis and kindling a flame in the dark hour.To build a better post-COVID world, the international community also needs to join hands to surmount all kinds of obstacles on the way forward with courage and strong will.Throughout the history of humanity, human society has managed to progress no matter what kinds of risks, disasters or countercurrents were along the way. Humanity shall and will continue to stride forward. As long as various parties follow the trend of history, embrace cooperation to defeat the virus, resolve various risks, bridge the development divide, and discard Cold War mentality, the international community will certainly create a better post-COVID world.

It features a coastline of 31 kilometres, and the current wetland area is about 90 square kilometres, which is criss-crossed by a dense river network.Dongzhai Port Mangrove Ecological Restoration ProjectOne of the first ecological restoration projects in the Jiangdong New Area started back in March 2019 at the Dongzhai Port mangroves.The project aims to effectively restore the coastline and coastal mangrove ecosystem of Dongzhai Port to ensure the ecological safety of Haikou’s Jiangdong New Area and provide a good habitat for migratory birds in China.Mangroves are known as nature’s coast guards. They prevent the erosion of coasts by waves and weather, and mangrove forests are listed as important tropical marine ecosystems alongside coral reefs, salt marshes, and sea grass.During the project, a total of more than one million mangrove tree saplings were planted on 321 acres.Maiya River Restoration ProjectNear the Jiangdong New Area Central Business District lies the Maiya River Ecological Restoration Project.What was once wasteland and acres of artificial fish ponds has been transformed into an environmentally friendly wetland park. In the very near future some of the world’s leading Fortune 500 companies and headquarters will be located adjacent to the park, a place where business and nature can co-exist.Prior to the redevelopment, the area was home to hundreds of aquaculture ponds, giving off unpleasant smells and discharged most of their waste water into nearby rivers, which had a negative effect on the environment.  The area now covers more than 362 acres, which in the future will be expanded to 1,403 acres of coastal wetlands.Since the project began, many birds and other wildlife have also returned to the area. The small ponds and trees offer a source of food and safe haven for these creatures. Award winning wetlandsThe Maiya River Restoration Project is a good example of how Haikou has promoted the ecological restoration of wetlands across the city. Other notable examples are the Wuyuan and Meishe River National Wetland Park.In recent years, Haikou City has had a good track record of implementing clean water development schemes and long term protection systems as well as water conservation and restoration projects.Previously Haikou City was included on the first list of the world’s “International Wetland Cities” and was awarded the Paulson Prize for Sustainability in the “Nature Stewardship” category.收起",640,0,24,2022-01-19 17:30:00

After a Nordic combined athlete made a leap from a platform at the base, the speed, take-off angle, dynamic posture, and other data immediately popped up on a screen thanks to the micro wearables worn by the athlete.The assistance system presents athletes’ training performance with visuals and data, and guides their future training in a science-based way.Technology is changing how athletes are training themselves for the games. At a national winter sports training and research center, a wind tunnel is employed to help athletes find the dynamic postures that generate the least air resistance. In Beishan Mountain, northeast China’s Jilin province, an air-raid shelter is transformed into a ski resort, where athletes can go training even in the summer.Apart from training, scientific innovation has also played a very crucial role in the construction of the venues for the Beijing Winter Olympics. It contributed to the site selection and module building of China’s first sliding track, and solved all kinds of technical problems in the construction of a series of venues, including the National Sliding Center and the National Ski Jumping Center.The National Aquatics Center, known as “Water Cube,” is the world’s first venue that has shifted from a swimming center to a curling sheet. It features multi-zone climate and humidity control, and is able to adapt itself to different sports in very short period of from time.From the stage of designing and evaluation to construction and operation, scientific innovation is aiding the preparation work for the Winter Games in every aspect.To some extent, the Olympics wouldn’t have been so popular around the world without the assistance from modern technology.New technologies are improving the hardware to bring better safety, precision and publicity to the Olympic Games. Besides, they can also constantly renew training methods, mechanisms and other software aspects, to make athletes faster, higher, stronger C together.Technological innovation is of high importance especially for winter sports, as winter sports athletes usually compete outdoors at high speed wearing a wide range of equipment. Therefore, China, implementing an action plan on the sci-tech innovation of the Winter Games, is sticking to independent innovation while learning advanced technologies from winter sports powers, so as to make constant breakthroughs in its ability to run and broadcast sports events, and to ensure safety of these events. Technologies applied in winter sports are also expected to have a spillover into relevant industries and the “white economy.” As China prepares to hold the Winter Games, a series of achievements are made by sci-tech innovation in infrastructure, green development and smart city construction. These achievements will become a treasure for the host cities, and continue to contribute to urban development, industrial vitalization and people’s livelihood.More importantly, such progress, be it the smart equipment used in the games that are later popularized, or the experience in smart venue construction, can help sports grounds across China optimize their management and functions. Technological outcomes achieved in the Winter Games will also improve the general efficiency of China’s winter sports industry, thus bringing higher quality to the rapid development of the sector.The “Experience Beijing” test events for the Beijing Winter Olympics have concluded, and they were lauded for bringing excellent facilities, venue operations and management.It’s believed that the approaching Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics will be made a grand event powered by technology, and attract attention from all over the world.

Over the past three decades, the country has witnessed continuous improvement in its wetland ecology thanks to the strenuous efforts it has made to conserve and restore wetlands.China’s wetlands account for only four percent of the world’s total wetland coverage, but they have well played their role in providing production and living resources, optimizing ecological environment, and offering cultural sites for 1/5 of the total population on Earth.The country has gone through three major stages in its wetland conservation. It learned about the general conditions of its wetlands between 1992 and 2003, which helped it lay a solid foundation for future conservation, and rescued them in the following 12 years. In the period between 2016 and 2021, the country carried out comprehensive protection over these wetlands. As a wetland protection law is coming into force this year in the country, China’s wetland conservation will embrace higher-quality development in a new era.The wetland protection law was passed at the end of the last year, and it was followed by relevant local regulations issued in 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. It will come into effect on June 1 this year.China currently has 64 sites designated as wetlands of international importance, and has established 602 wetland nature reserves, over 1,600 wetland parks and a number of community conserved areas for wetlands, putting 52.65 percent of its wetlands under protection.In 2003, the State Council approved and released a national engineering plan on wetland protection for the period between 2002 and 2030, under which China has invested a total of 19.8 billion yuan ($3.11 billion) and implemented over 4,100 engineering projects to help local efforts in wetland conservation and restoration.China is the first country in the world to have completed three nationwide investigations on wetland resources. The third national land resource survey of the country officially placed wetlands in the top-level category of China’s land classification system.As a member of the Standing Committee and chair of the Scientific and Technical Review Panel of the Ramsar Convention, China is contributing its wisdom and schemes to global ecological governance.So far, China has established 899 national wetland parks since it initiated a pilot program in 2005. These parks, as a part of the national nature reserve system, have effectively put 2.4 million hectares of wetlands under protection, bringing about 50 billion yuan of economic benefits. About 90 percent of the national wetland parks are open to the public free of charge. (By Li Xiaoqing, People’s Daily)",241,5,2,2022-01-19 13:00:00

Last year, the country’s foreign trade surpassed the $5 trillion and $6 trillion marks, compared with over $4 trillion in the previous year.China’s imports and exports with major trading partners achieved stable increase, and its trade models were further optimized in 2021.During last year, private enterprises in the country played a more active role in foreign trade; the country’s imports and exports of mechanical and electrical products maintained a sound growth momentum; and the actual use of foreign capital in China’s high-tech industry and service sector climbed 17.1 percent and 16.7 percent respectively from the previous year. The country’s foreign trade and foreign investment inflow achieved steady improvement in both quantity and quality.Against the background characterized by the blows of a massive epidemic, faster evolution of major changes unseen in a century in the world, and the increasingly complex, grim and uncertain external environment, China’s economy has maintained stable operation, with the foundation for industrial development constantly consolidated and vitality of economic development enhanced.Many international economic organizations predicted that the year-on-year growth of China’s economy in 2021 surpassed the expected growth of other major economies.China’s lead in the world in terms of COVID-19 containment has been a key underlying factor behind its globally leading position in pursuing economic development.Faced with repeated variations of the virus, China sticks to the overall strategy of preventing imported cases and domestic re-infections and the “dynamic zero-case policy”, and continuously improves the vaccination coverage, laying solid underpinning for balancing epidemic prevention and control as well as economic and social development.China has not only achieved stable operation of its own economy, but helped maintain the stability of the global industrial chain and supply chain together with its trading partners, effectively propping up global fight against the virus and world economic recovery.China’s role as an anchor and driver for the world economy is becoming more evident, which proves that China’s insistence on effectively coordinating COVID-19 responses with economic and social development and implementing prudent macroeconomic policies, a truly responsible move taken by a major country, is conducive to the recovery and development of the world economy.China’s “magnetic attraction” to foreign investment continues to increase, demonstrating huge opportunities offered by the country’s super-large market.China has a population of more than 1.4 billion and a middle-income group of more than 400 million people, which makes the scale and potential of its consumer market unparalleled. Besides, as the country boasts complete industrial supporting facilities, sound infrastructure, rich human resources and other prominent advantages, and has constantly improved its business environment, it will show greater appeal to foreign investors.In 2022, China’s foreign direct investment (FDI) is expected to remain robust, according to a report recently released by KPMG.A survey conducted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) showed 97 percent of the companies surveyed plan to continuously increase their investment in China. Senior executives of many American enterprises also announced that they will expand their business in China in the next decade.By advocating open cooperation and promoting the construction of an open world economy, China has enabled the rest of the world to share the dividends of its economic growth and prosperous consumption.In 2021, the imports and exports of China’s comprehensive bonded zones, pilot free trade zones, and Hainan free trade port grew 24.3 percent, 26.4 percent, and 57.7 percent, respectively, signaling greater importance of the country’s platforms set up to promote opening-up.China’s foreign trade with countries along the Belt and Road rose 23.6 percent year on year to 11.6 trillion yuan last year, 2.2 percentage points higher than the overall growth rate of China’s foreign trade in the same period. The unimpeded trade between China and countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has fully demonstrated how the high-quality joint construction of the BRI can stimulate the development of the world economy.

This is a time when countries around the world need to work together. Only mutual assistance and solidarity can help them defeat the global challenge.The world needs solidarity more than ever to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and the huge challenges facing mankind, said Bach, who proposed to add the notion of “Together” to the Olympic motto the last year. It marked the first time that the motto has been updated since it was incorporated into the Olympic Charter in 1913, which mirrored the common aspiration of mankind to address challenges with solidarity.As the first international multi-sport event to be held as scheduled since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Beijing 2022 is supported by both the Chinese people and the international society.In his meeting with Xi, Bach wished for a world of greater unity. Abdulla Shahid, president of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly also solemnly appealed to all UN member states to demonstrate their commitment to the Olympic Truce for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. Besides, there have been voices supporting the Beijing 2022 made by political dignitaries of many countries and IOC officials. It proves that the Beijing 2022 will be not only a grand sports event, but also a platform demonstrating the solidarity and friendship of mankind.The 2022 Winter Olympics is a bond linking the hearts of the people around the world. Pupils at Millburn Primary School in Northern Ireland sang ""Meet Me in Beijing,"" a song that will be played during this year's Olympics opening ceremony in Chinese, as a tribute to Beijing 2022 Winter Games. Two years ago, they also dedicated a Chinese song to the people of China suffering from the COVID-19 outbreak.A Russian retired medic wrote a song for Beijing Winter Olympics; a South Korean artist made Winter Olympics-themed paintings; a Brazilian girl drew a picture of the Beijing Winter Olympics in her imagination. In different ways, people have expressed the same aspiration for solidarity and a better future. What they have done embodies the Olympic spirit that transcends national borders.Sports is a common language of mankind. Nearly 3,000 athletes from around 90 countries and regions are expected to gather in Beijing soon, and some countries will send delegations to the Winter Games for the first time.Vice secretary general Varin Tansuphasiri of the National Olympic Committee of Thailand believes that winning is not the most important part of the Olympic Games, and what matter are the opportunity for athletes to join the games, and the friendship and peace of mankind.As Sri Lanka marked the 30-day countdown to the opening of the Beijing 2022, the country’s Cabinet Minister of Youth and Sports Namal Rajapaksa noted that the people in his country will embrace the Winter Games and the Olympic spirit together with the rest of the world, though Sri Lanka is a tropical island country that doesn’t have many winter sports resources.Another tropical country Columbia will also send athletes to Beijing. Colombian President Ivan Duque said the Beijing 2022 bears significance for the entire world.

Locke, a Black man, died while police officers were carrying out a warrant related to a homicide investigation in the neighboring city of St. Paul, according to police. Police say Locke was pointing a handgun at an officer, reports NBC news. Bodycam video appears to show someone on a couch, covered by a blanket and then getting up with a gun. Locke’s family and attorneys say the gun was licensed, he was sleeping on the couch and was startled by police entering the home. The Minneapolis Police Department says Locke was not named in the original warrant. In his announcement ending the police procedure, Frey says the only way for police to execute a no-knock warrant under this new directive is if there is “imminent threat of harm to an individual or the public and then the warrant must be approved by the chief."" Otherwise, police must use the “knock-and-announce” approach, which includes knocking, announcing, waiting and then entering. #Minneapolis #BLM #police #St.Paul #AmirLocke #cgtnamerica",125,4,8,2022-02-06 03:46:42

Among the team are professional medical staff from major hospitals in Beijing. In order to become qualified ski doctors, they have to go through strict ski training. Some have even obtained international certified ski instructor qualifications.Recently, 38 ski doctors and medical officers from China officially entered the National Alpine Ski Center venue for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. More than 10 medical points were set up for different events.""China's alpine ski doctors will make their debut in the Beijing Winter Olympics,"" said Liang Xueya, the medical officer at the National Alpine Ski Center in the Beijing Winter Olympics.

Dressed in clothes and shoes featuring a tiger image, they sang the Olympic anthem in Greek. This choir, named the Malanhua Children's Choir, is from Malan Village in north China's Hebei Province.How did these children from a small village make it to the grand stage of the opening ceremony? It's all thanks to Deng Xiaolan, a 78-year-old woman who founded the choir. Due to her personal experiences since childhood and her love for the village, she has always regarded this place as her ""second hometown."" After learning that children in Malan had lost the valuable opportunity to receive music education because of the village's remote location, she sought to change the situation.Following her retirement in 2004, Deng spent six months in Malan every year, voluntarily giving music classes to local children. With her earnest teaching, children learned to sing songs and play the violin. In 2006, Deng established the choir and led the children to perform in Beijing, Shanghai and many other big cities around China. This year, they performed at the Winter Olympics. Netizens commented that Deng had changed the village and children's lives with music. Now, the children have given back to the world with beautiful songs.""A wonderful world outside the mountains is what children desire the most.

Antivirals are now starting to be approved to help reduce the risk of people becoming seriously ill.  But what are the side effects and what impact will they have in the real world?  Emma Keeling spoke to three scientists to see how antivirals will help the world to live with COVID-19.   How long is a second? It’s a question most of us have never even really considered. But one that has captivated physicists for centuries not least because the most accurate answer to that question promises to reveal the deepest truths about the make-up of our universe. Jun Ye is a Chinese-American physicist and clockmaker extraordinaire at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He has built an optical lattice clock, a cloud of 100,000's of thousands of strontium atoms, which is inching closer to redefining the second. Ye's clock is so precise that it neither gains nor loses one second in some 15 billion years, roughly the age of the universe.

Ice and snow culture in China dates back to a long time ago. Inheritance of and innovation in ice and snow culture in China crystalize the wisdom of harmonious relationship between human society and nature and embody the practical experience of the Chinese nation in understanding and utilizing nature.Petroglyph of skiers found in a cave in Altay city, northern edge of Junggar Basin, northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, is so far one of the earliest records of humankind’s skiing activities.Skiing, as a means of transport for human beings in snowy mountains in winter, has a history of at least 10,000 years, as the petroglyph suggested.To survive cold winter, ancient Chinese people of various ethnic groups in northern China gradually turned ice and snow to their own advantage. For example, the ancients’ innovations for illumination in winter have evolved into today’s ice lanterns that people like watching so much.To strengthen defense, ancient Chinese people could build ramparts overnight by turning water into ice and then mixing it with earth. Moreover, they invented sledges so as to move faster when hunting in winter, and made use of ice and snow to store food to guarantee sufficient food supply in cold months. The tradition of food storage in winter has been followed to this day.As people’s needs for survival in winter were satisfied, ice and snow sports and art, which were oriented to recreation and relaxation, started to emerge. According to historical records, skating was a verified ancient ice and snow recreational activity. During the reign of Emperor Qianlong (1736 - 1796) of the Qing dynasty, ice and snow sports became quite popular, and a series of activities on ice, including skating, ice skate archery and rolling on ice, took shape, which involved early forms of skates and sledges.In modern times, Chinese people began to add different colors to the colorless ice and white snow by developing environment-friendly pigments, and decorate urban areas in northern China with ice lanterns and ice and snow sculptures, expanding ice and snow application scenarios.The first Harbin Ice Lantern Garden Party held in Harbin city, northeast China’s Heilongjiang province, in 1963, effectively fueled the emergence of ice and snow art in various regions across China.In Shenzhen, south China’s Guangdong province, people have built low-temperature winter sports venues with air domes, where the all-white structures and snowmakers and other facilities inside simulate realistic indoor ice and snow sports fields. Wenzhou city, east China’s Zhejiang province, has established scenario-based indoor ski centers and ice and snow theme parks, breaking the geography and season limits of ice and snow sports and culture.The designs of venues for the 2022 Olympic Winter Games represent creative transformation of ice and snow elements. The National Ski Jumping Center in Zhangjiakou city, north China’s Hebei province, one of the venues, features an S-shaped curve which resembles a jade Ruyi scepter, a Chinese talisman. The design is expected to convey good wishes.In the digital era, virtual reality (VR), digital twin, virtual studio and other technologies are widely adopted in the culture sector, allowing ice and snow culture to further break the restrictions of season and transformation and be inherited in new ways.With the help of a 360-degree camera that captures panoramic images of ice and snow and a VR helmet equipped with locator and supporting different angles, users can experience the fun of being in a world of ice and snow. Injury-free ski training, which features the combination of VR headsets and indoor ski training equipment, has benefited an increasing number of winter sports enthusiasts.The ongoing Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games have employed digital technologies for broadcasting, which effectively enrich the experience of the audience.One of the new explorations in the innovative development of ice and snow culture is reproducing ice and snow figures in ancient artworks or creating virtual ice and snow figures via digital technologies.Thanks to the digital transformation of an ancient painting depicting a grand skating event over 200 years ago, more than 1,000 figures in the painting seem to have been brought back to life and a large-scale on-ice competition in ancient times has been vividly reproduced.An online video introduced by China Mobile, which is based on the story of Chinese freestyle skier Gu Ailing, has successfully created the image of a virtual winter sports athlete.In its integration with digital technologies, ice and snow culture has embraced further development and transformation, during which people’s experiences of the culture have also been constantly enriched.

It's an unmistakable tribute to a special genre of Chinese fine art, the Blue and Green Landscape paintings, which originated in the Sui and Tang period and were revived in the Song Dynasty. The unique colors of azurite blue and malachite green come from precious minerals, rendering them an extravagance for Chinese artists as ultramarine blue was for Renaissance oil painters in the West. That's why this type of landscape paintings were mostly for the royal courts or wealthy families.One such painting was an 11.9-meter long scroll known as ""A Panorama of Mountains and Rivers"", projected on screens above and behind the dancers. It was painted around 900 years ago by an 18-year old genius painter for his Northern-Song emperor patron. Take a snapshot of any section of this painting and it's your dream screensaver.

Antivirals are now starting to be approved to help reduce the risk of people becoming seriously ill.  But what are the side effects and what impact will they have in the real world?

11261,1,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=481042486821047," It’s estimated we’ll need to upskill or reskill at least 85 million people by 2030 to prevent the global economy losing more than $8 trillion in GDP, as a result of artificial intelligence, automation, changing demographics and globalisation.That’s got the world of business, politics and education talking - or better still, thinking. So, this week on The Agenda, Stephen Cole finds out why Critical Thinking is such a sought-after skill, how it’s being taught in education, whether politicians are applying it enough and learns who are most likely to become the thinkers of the future.Opening the show, Salah Khalil - Director of Macat International - joins Stephen to explain the overall concept of critical thinking and why it’s increasingly adopted by businesses to help humans compete with the machines of the future.Lord Jim Knight joins the conversation to express how important it is for academia not to overlook the potential of using play-based learning as way of fostering critical thinking, which he says can significantly improve productivity in all areas of our lives.And closing the show is Anthony McClaran, Vice-Chancellor of St. Mary's University in London. Anthony tells Stephen why critical thinking has been adopted as part of their curriculum, and why the use of social media by students is often a background barrier to their teaching efforts.Learn more on #TheAgenda at: https://www.cgtn.com/europe/the-agenda 收起请访问新冠疫情信息中心了解疫苗相关资源。了解疫苗信息",87,2551,19,0

With a history of more than 2,000 years, the Lantern Festival is a traditional folk festival, but also as an important occasion for #family #reunions, for family members to get together, savor delicious food and enjoy festive folk-art performances.As the name suggests, lanterns will be hung out for the festival. The lanterns represent wishes for a bright future. Traditionally, the lanterns are red, an auspicious color in Chinese culture. Nowadays, however, lanterns are made in a variety of colors and forms, with the auspicious Chinese elements such as zodiac signs, lotus, dragons, and phoenix being favored design choices. During the evening, with all the bulbs turned on, the lantern fairs look as bright as they would during the daytime.Lantern Festival is also called “Yuanxiao Festival” because people usually eat Yuanxiao or Tangyuan, a glutinous rice ball usually filled with sweet fillings such as red bean paste, sesame paste, or peanut butter during the festival. People believe that the round shape of the ball and its sweet fillings symbolize family unity, completeness, and happiness for the entire year.收起",6,3167,29,0
